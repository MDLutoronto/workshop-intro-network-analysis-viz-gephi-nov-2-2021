# Workshop Recording: Introduction to Network Analysis and Visualization Using Gephi (Nov. 2, 2021)

This page provides a video recording of an introductory workshop on using Gephi for network analysis and visualization.

**Workshop Description:**

A network is a way of specifying relationships among a collection of entities or actors. Networks come up in a variety of situations; for example, they can describe relationships between characters in literary works, how authors cite each other in a particular discipline or how people interact on social media.

Through a combination of lecture and hands\-on activities, this workshop will introduce you to network visualization using a free, open\-source tool called Gephi. For our examples, we will be starting with smaller networks, looking at relationships between characters in the play Romeo and Juliet, and movie actors that work together on the same films.

This workshop is designed for those new to networks and Gephi. There are no prerequisites or assumptions of knowledge of math, statistics, or programming.

Gephi is an open\-source program that can be [downloaded for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux](https://gephi.org/users/download/).
